  data: Hi! My name is Curtis Bucher and I am a high school student from Newport Beach, California. I am interested in Python Programming, Machine Learning, Computer Hardware, and Vinyl Records. I always enjoy keeping my mind engaged, and at any given time I can expect to be working on several personal projects, including this site! I am an avid reader, and greatly enjoy reading a wide range of books on a variety of subjects. However, I expecially enjoy reading biographies. I love getting coffee with friends, and binging TV shows on Netflix. My favorite of which are Friends and the Office.
