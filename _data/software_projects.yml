  data: Votify was a project that I came up with when my freinds and I all disagreed on the songs to play when we were listening to music. I thought it would be really cool to, using Python and Spotify's web API, create a service that allowed people to vote on the next song that would play in their queue. I am using a server that allows people to navigate to a website on their phone and make a selection from a list of four songs to play. I modelled the UI after the game Kahoot. I am currently still working on the project, but I expect it to be completed very soon.

  data: I beleive it is almost a right of passage for any young programmer to create a chess program. It is a fun challenge, and a project that can constantly be improved and worked on. I am constantly working on this project, but it wasn't untill recently that the computer beat me in chess for the first time. I am by no means good at chess, but it was very exciting to watch.

  data: Desert Island will always have a special place in my heart. I developed the game after a card game my freinds and I created. It is essentially an RPG that takes place on a deserted Island, where the goal of the game is to survive and escape the island. I have probably made 5 or 6 attempts to perfect this game, in every medium from a text-based game, to a board game, but this particular version holds a special place in my heart as one of my first programming projects.

  data: Planet Explorer is a game I created after reading an article on hashing and random noise generation. Less of a game than a proof of concept, planet explorer follows a lone astronaught as he navigates an infinite number of infinitely large, procedurely generated universes. The universes contains procedurely generated stars and planets, and includes realistic space physics.

  data: Tank Commander was my final project for a CS class I took Junior year. The goal of the game is to teach programming to children through the fun, tactical lense of trying to destroy an AI tank. I never got around to improving the game after I turned in my final project, but I love the concept of it.
