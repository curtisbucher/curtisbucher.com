- title: Software
  text: I love programming and computer science. It is an incredibly creative, intellectually challenging medium, supported by a huge community of like-minded geeks around the world. Through this magical medium, you are given complete, uncontested control over the little, logical world of your computer. You can accomplish anything you can imagine! Programming is the future, and will have huge implications in every feild, from medicine to agriculture. If you care to hear me, or Linus Torvalds rant more about the unbridled joy of programming, check out my blog posts about "the beauty of programming". 

- title: Hardware
  text: I have always had a soft spot for hardware. I love programming and CS, but there is something incredibly pleasing and tactile about manipulating wires, chips, semiconductors, and breadboards to do your bidding. You are not confined in the logical world of a computer, but rather in a real life world defined by physics and chaos. That being said, hardware is always a challenge, accounting not only for logical, discreet variables in a computer, but for bad wires, RF interference and any number of bugs that like to screw with your sanity.

- title: Music
  text: Without music, life would be incredibly dull. I love everything about music, accross all genres, but I particulary enjoy classic rock. My favorite artists are The Eagles, Little River Band, Jim Croce, Billy Joel, The Arctic Monkeys, and, of course, the Beatles. There is somethign incredibly powerful and mystic in how music is able to manipulate our emotions and memories. I am a self-defined audiophile and vinyl nut, with a collection of close to 100 albums. If you care to hear me rant about the merits of vinyl and the shortcommings of digital, check out my blog post on "the beauty of vinyl".
