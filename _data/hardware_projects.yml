  data: This is a discreet four bit adder I designed and constructed using 60 RTL NAND gates. All the gates are designed using RTL (transistor resistor logic). In order to keep the transistor count down, the adders use positive and floating signals rather than the traditional positive and negative signals used in digital electronics. This allows the board to use 2/5ths of the digital transistor count. It was a great learning experience, you can learn all about it and the steps I took to build it by following the link.

  data: My brother a software engineer, decided one day to write an OS completely in brainf*ck, called braiNIX. Knowing that I was interested in hardware, he asked me if I wanted to createa computer that could natively run his braiNIX. The braiNIAC was born. Brainf*ck, in simple terms, it is an esoteric programming language, designed to be the simplest possible Turing-complete language. The computer is constructed using 7400 series logic gates as well as static RAM, and some parallel EEPROM chips for command logic, as well as storing the program. I am still working on this project, and am learning much about digital logic, circuit design, assembly and esoteric programming.

  data: Recently I have been trying to break into elusive world of programmable logic; years of fumbling around with jumper wires and breadboards is enough to make anyone try something so rash. Unfortunately, it appears that designing a computer is hard no matter how you do it, but at least fumbling on a keyboard feels more productive than fumbling with wires. Anyway, I have been spending my free time recently attempting to impliment a simple VGA card on an Spartan 6 FPGA.
